# **What I leaned week 6**

## Operators
### *Ternary:*

* *condition? value1: value2*

* *Checks the condition first and then executes the first command if true and then the second command if false*

### *Unary:*
```
let operatorsAreCool = true;
operatorsAreCool = !operatorsAreCool;
operatorsAreCool = false;
```
### *Binary:*
```
5 + 4;
4 * 9;
5 / 4;
4 - 9;
etc...
```
### *Switch Statements:*

* *switch checks for one* **VALUE**
```
switch(expression) {

  case x:
     // code block

        break;

  case y:

     // code block

     break;

  default:

      // code block

 }
```

### *Front End:*

*The front end handles all of the users input. process.argv[] is used to handle the actual input of the user. The front end can be modified for whatever you want the user to be able to do. Can be very simple but can also be extremely in depth.* 

### *Back End:*

*The back end handles all of the functions and actual code. All databases are found on the backend. Node is used to create all the functions and data put into the backend. The backend stores everything until the front end calls it and says it needs something.*
